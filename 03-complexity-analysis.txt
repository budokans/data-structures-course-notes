What is complexity in computer science?

Complexity is the concept of how much time an operation takes to execute and how much space in memory an operation needs to accomplish its task.

Both are measured in Big O notation.

Data structures are strongly linked to the complexity of algorithms, because different types of data structures have different time and space complexity ramifications for the operations they support.

A well-designed, highly-performant algorithm utilises the best known data structures and operation types to achieve its goal, with the lowest space time complexity possible.

Note: depending on use case, a lower time complexity or lower space complexity may be preferred.
