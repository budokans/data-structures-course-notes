1. What actually is coding?

Coding is simply manipulating data to achieve some purpose. If you're coding on the frontend of a web application, you're retrieving data from and posting data and changes to an API, manipulating the data to get it in a human readable format, and then displaying it on a screen.

If you're building an API, you're mostly retrieving data from a server, processing it and sending it to a client that requests it.

2. What are data structures?

Data structures are collections of data, the relationships between those data, and the operations that can be used on them.
